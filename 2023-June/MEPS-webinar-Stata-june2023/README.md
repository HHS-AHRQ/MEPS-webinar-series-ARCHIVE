# MEPS-HC June 2023 Webinar Series

## Stata session: Linking Medical Conditions to Prescribed Medicines
### June 8, 2023

This repository contains materials for the AHRQ webinar on linking MEPS-HC medical conditions to prescribed medicines using Stata.

This webinar will cover an applied example of how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions public use data file to the Prescribed Medicines public use data file using STATA. The example will cover loading MEPS data into STATA, merging data sets, and using survey procedures to estimate prescribed medicine utilization and expenditures for the treatment of hyperlipidemia among the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 2020. Basic familiarity with MEPS-HC and STATA are recommended.
