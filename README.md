# MEPS-webinar-series-ARCHIVE
This repository archives materials from previous MEPS programming webinar series.

Materials from each webinar are organized into folders, categorized by the month and year of the webinar. The content primarily focuses on programming examples in R, SAS, and Stata.

MEPS Webinar Series
MEPS organizes a series of programming webinars aimed at intermediate to advanced MEPS analysts. These webinars are held on an ad hoc basis and typically delve into advanced programming techniques. Key topics include merging multiple data sets, applying appropriate statistical analyses for complex survey data, and exploring the intricacies of MEPS survey variables.

Slides and programming exercises from the most recent Webinar Series are available in the [MEPS-webinar-series](https://github.com/HHS-AHRQ/MEPS-webinar-series) repository. After each webinar series, these materials are transferred to this ARCHIVE repository.

## MEPS Workshops

MEPS Data Users Workshops are held twice a year (in spring and fall). Additional webinars are provided throughout the year on an ad hoc basis. Presentation slides and programming exercises from the most recent Data Users Workshops are available in the [MEPS-workshop](https://github.com/HHS-AHRQ/MEPS-workshop) repository.
