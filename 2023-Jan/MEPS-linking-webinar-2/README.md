# MEPS-HC Winter Webinar Series

## Part 2 of 2: Linking Medical Conditions to Medical Events
### January 31, 2023

This repository contains materials for the AHRQ webinar on linking MEPS-HC medical conditions to office-based visits. This is part 2 of a 2-part webinar series on linking MEPS-HC conditions to event files:
* [MEPS-linking-webinar-1](https://github.com/HHS-AHRQ/MEPS-linking-webinar-1) (Jan 24, 2023)
* [MEPS-linking-webinar-2](https://github.com/HHS-AHRQ/MEPS-linking-webinar-2) (Jan 31, 2023)

This webinar will cover an applied example of how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions public use data file to the Office-Based Medical Provider Visits public use data file using SAS. The example will cover loading MEPS data into SAS, merging data sets, and using survey procedures to estimate utilization and expenditures related to mental health treatment among the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population in 2020. Basic familiarity with MEPS-HC and SAS (version 9.4) is recommended.

Example R code is also provided in this respository for reference.
