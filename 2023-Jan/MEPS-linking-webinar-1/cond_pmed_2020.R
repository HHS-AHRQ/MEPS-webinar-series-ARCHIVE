# MEPS-HC: Prescribed medicine utilization and expenditures for 
# the treatment of hyperlipidemia
# 
# This example code shows how to link the MEPS-HC Medical Conditions file 
# to the Prescribed Medicines file for data year 2020 in order to estimate
# the following:
#   
# Event-level estimates:
#   - Total rx fills for the treatment of hyperlipidemia
#   - Total rx expenditures for the treatment of hyperlipidemia 
# 
# Person-level estimates 
#   - Total number of people treated for hyperlipidemia (any health care)
#   - Number of people treated for hyperlipidemia with prescribed medicines
#   - Mean number of rx fills and drugs per person for hyperlipidemia
#     treatment (among those with any rx fills for hyperlipidemia)
#   - Mean rx expenditures per person for the treatment of hyperlipidemia
#     (among those with any rx fills for hyperlipidemia)
# 
# Input files:
#   - h220a.dta        (2020 Prescribed Medicines file)
#   - h222.dta         (2020 Conditions file)
#   - h220if1.dta      (2020 CLNK: Condition-Event Link file)
#   - h224.dta         (2020 Full-Year Consolidated file)

# Install/load packages and set global options --------------------------------

# For each package that you don't already have installed, un-comment
# and run.  Skip this step if all packages below are already installed.

# install.packages("survey")     # for survey analysis
# install.packages("haven")      # for loading Stata (.dta) files
# install.packages("tidyverse")  # for data manipulation
# install.packages("devtools")   # for loading "MEPS" package from GitHub


# If MEPS package is not installed, un-comment and run to install

# library(devtools)
# install_github("e-mitchell/meps_r_pkg/MEPS")


# Load libraries

library(MEPS)     
library(survey)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)


# Set survey option for lonely PSUs

options(survey.lonely.psu="adjust")


# Load datasets ---------------------------------------------------------------

# RX = Prescribed medicines (PMED) file (record = rx fill or refill)
# Conditions = Medical conditions file (record = medical condition)
# CLNK = Conditions-event link file (crosswalk between conditions and 
#        events, including PMED events)
# FYC = Full year consolidated file (record = MEPS sample person)


### Option 1 - load data files using read_MEPS from the MEPS package

# For PMED file, rename LINKIDX to EVNTIDX to merge with Conditions

pmed20 <- read_MEPS(year = 2020, type = "RX") %>% rename(EVNTIDX=LINKIDX)

clnk20 <- read_MEPS(year = 2020, type = "CLNK")
fyc20  <- read_MEPS(year = 2020, type = "FYC")


### Option 2 - load Stata data files using read_dta from the haven package 

# Replace "C:/MEPS" below with the directory you saved the files to.
# For PMED file, rename LINKIDX to EVNTIDX to merge with Conditions

# pmed20 <- read_dta("C:/MEPS/h220a.dta") %>% rename(EVNTIDX=LINKIDX)

# Example to show someone with 'duplicate' hyperlipidemia conditions with
# different CONDIDXs.  This usually happens when the collapsed 3-digit 
# ICD10s are the same but the fully-specified ICD10s are different

# For example, the same drug/fill can link to both E78.1 and E78.5.  

# An example illustrating the above issue.  Note that there are 'duplicate'
